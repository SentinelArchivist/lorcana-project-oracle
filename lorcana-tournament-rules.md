**Effective 10/3/2023**

-----

## 0\. Purpose

[cite\_start]Ravensburger and the Disney Lorcana Trading Card Game Organized Play Team work to provide a welcoming, open, supportive, and safe environment for all event participants. [cite: 46] [cite\_start]Part of this work includes setting rules and standards for tournament roles, processes, and game play procedures. [cite: 47] [cite\_start]All tournament participants agree to abide by the rules outlined in this document. [cite: 48] [cite\_start]Corrective action may be taken if these rules are not followed. [cite: 49] [cite\_start]Other applicable documents that participants must all adhere to include: [cite: 50]

  * [cite\_start]Disney Lorcana TCG Community Code [cite: 51]
  * [cite\_start]Disney Lorcana TCG Correction Guidelines [cite: 52]
  * [cite\_start]Disney Lorcana TCG Organized Play Diversity & Inclusion Policy [cite: 53]

-----

## 1\. Tournament Definitions

### 1.1 Tournament Types

[cite\_start]Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are divided into two types: [cite: 56]

  * [cite\_start]**Limited** tournaments are played with unopened Disney Lorcana TCG product that is provided by the Tournament Organizer. [cite: 57] [cite\_start]Players are not expected to bring any Disney Lorcana TCG cards with them to participate in a Limited tournament. [cite: 58] [cite\_start]Limited includes the Preconstructed, Sealed, and Draft variants. [cite: 59]
  * [cite\_start]**Constructed** tournaments are played with decks that the players have built before the tournament begins. [cite: 60] [cite\_start]Each player is responsible for bringing a deck that is legal for the specific Constructed format being played at that tournament. [cite: 61]

### 1.2 Tournament Levels

[cite\_start]Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are divided into two levels. [cite: 63]

  * [cite\_start]**Casual** tournaments are played with more relaxed rules and fewer, if any, prizes. [cite: 64] [cite\_start]These tournaments are intended for less serious play; tournament officials are responsible for assuring that these events are welcoming to less-experienced players. [cite: 65]
  * [cite\_start]**Competitive** tournaments are intended for more serious play, with stricter rules and higher expectations of players. [cite: 66]

### 1.3 Tournament Roles

[cite\_start]Tournaments may have multiple roles represented: [cite: 68]

  * [cite\_start]Tournament Organizer [cite: 70]
  * [cite\_start]Head Judge [cite: 71]
  * [cite\_start]Floor Judge [cite: 72]
  * [cite\_start]Scorekeeper [cite: 73]
  * [cite\_start]Player [cite: 74]
  * [cite\_start]Spectator [cite: 75]

[cite\_start]All of the above roles except Player and Spectator are considered Tournament Officials. [cite: 77] [cite\_start]For purposes of this document, "judge" refers to anyone acting as Head Judge or floor judge in that tournament. [cite: 78]

### 1.4 Eligible Players and Tournament Officials

[cite\_start]Anyone is eligible to play in any Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, with the following exceptions: [cite: 80]

  * [cite\_start]Anyone currently banned from playing in Disney Lorcana TCG events. [cite: 81]
  * [cite\_start]Any Tournament Official for that tournament. [cite: 81]

[cite\_start]Anyone is eligible to serve as a Tournament Official for a Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, with the following exceptions: [cite: 82]

  * [cite\_start]Anyone currently banned from playing in Disney Lorcana TCG events. [cite: 83]
  * [cite\_start]Anyone who has played in that tournament, even if they have dropped. [cite: 84]

-----

## 2\. Tournament Roles

### 2.1 Tournament Organizer

[cite\_start]The Tournament Organizer for a Disney Lorcana TCG tournament is responsible for a number of tasks, including but not limited to: [cite: 87]

  * [cite\_start]Obtaining permission from Ravensburger to run the tournament. [cite: 88]
  * [cite\_start]Providing and furnishing a sufficient site to run the tournament. [cite: 89]
  * [cite\_start]Promoting the tournament to ensure sufficient attendance. [cite: 89]
  * [cite\_start]Advertising the tournament type and format for player preparation. [cite: 90]
  * [cite\_start]Acquiring sufficient staff for the tournament (e.g., judges and a scorekeeper). [cite: 91]
  * [cite\_start]Reporting the tournament results to Ravensburger. [cite: 91]

### 2.2 Head Judge

[cite\_start]Every Disney Lorcana TCG tournament must have a Tournament Official designated as the Head Judge for that event. [cite: 93] [cite\_start]This person must be physically present throughout the duration of the event. [cite: 94] [cite\_start]For Casual tournaments, the Tournament Organizer may serve as the Head Judge. [cite: 95] [cite\_start]For Competitive tournaments, they must be two separate individuals. [cite: 96]

[cite\_start]The Head Judge is the final arbiter for any rules or tournament policy disputes at a Disney Lorcana TCG tournament. [cite: 97] [cite\_start]It is their responsibility to enforce the codes in this document, the Disney Lorcana TCG Full Rules, and the Disney Lorcana TCG Penalty Guidelines. [cite: 98] [cite\_start]All tournament participants are expected to abide by the Head Judge's decisions. [cite: 99]

[cite\_start]For smaller tournaments, the Head Judge should be the only judge needed. [cite: 100] [cite\_start]For larger tournaments, the Head Judge is expected to delegate tasks to other judges as necessary to facilitate smooth tournament function and timely responses to player questions. [cite: 101]

[cite\_start]If a player is dissatisfied with a judge's ruling, they may appeal the ruling to the Head Judge. [cite: 102] [cite\_start]The Head Judge's ruling is final. [cite: 103]

[cite\_start]If any players must be disqualified or otherwise removed from a tournament, the Head Judge must write a report of the incident and submit it to Ravensburger. [cite: 105]

### 2.3 Judges

[cite\_start]Judges are charged with assisting players with rules questions and handling errors made during play. [cite: 107] [cite\_start]They are expected to be impartial and to avoid assisting players with in-game strategy. [cite: 108] [cite\_start]Judges should not prevent play mistakes from happening but should instead only pause a match if an illegal action is taken or if a situation requires de-escalation. [cite: 109] [cite\_start]Judges should hold themselves to a high standard of sporting behavior and should exemplify this to players and spectators whenever serving as a judge for a tournament. [cite: 110]

### 2.4 Scorekeeper

[cite\_start]The Scorekeeper is responsible for recording all tournament results and generating all tournament pairings. [cite: 112] [cite\_start]For smaller tournaments, this role may be served by the Tournament Organizer or a judge. [cite: 113] [cite\_start]This person should be familiar with the Melee software (www.melee.gg) so that any issues or errors can be corrected in a timely manner and with minimal disruption to the tournament. [cite: 114] [cite\_start]If any egregious tournament scorekeeping issues arise, the Head Judge is the final arbiter for determining the appropriate action. [cite: 115]

### 2.5 Player

[cite\_start]Players in Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments have several responsibilities: [cite: 117]

  * [cite\_start]Always being respectful and courteous toward Tournament Officials, other players, and spectators. [cite: 119]
  * [cite\_start]Refraining from unsporting conduct at all times. [cite: 120]
  * [cite\_start]Arriving for the tournament and for all matches punctually. [cite: 121]
  * [cite\_start]Supplying all required tournament materials, including an appropriate deck for Constructed tournaments. [cite: 122] [cite\_start]This can also include dice, a playmat, pen and paper, and non-marked card sleeves. [cite: 123]
  * [cite\_start]For Competitive Constructed tournaments, submitting their deck list via Melee or on paper. [cite: 124]
  * [cite\_start]Verifying that their match results are reported promptly and accurately. [cite: 125]
  * [cite\_start]Properly communicating with their opponent to the best of their ability. [cite: 126]
  * [cite\_start]Bringing any and all issues to the attention of a judge as soon as they are noticed. [cite: 127]
  * [cite\_start]Abiding by the rules of this document, the Disney Lorcana TCG Full Rules, the Disney Lorcana TCG Correction Guidelines, and all rulings made by judges. [cite: 128]

[cite\_start]Any assistance given by a judge does not remove these responsibilities. [cite: 129]

### 2.6 Spectator

[cite\_start]Spectators are expected to allow Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments to proceed unaffected by their observation. [cite: 131] [cite\_start]Any person physically present at a Disney Lorcana TCG event who is not filling a designated tournament role is considered a spectator. [cite: 132] [cite\_start]Spectators are expected to remain silent and unobtrusive while matches proceed, with one exception. [cite: 133] [cite\_start]If a spectator observes a rule violation, they should ask the players to pause their game while the spectator notifies a judge. [cite: 134] [cite\_start]The spectator should not reveal any details of the perceived violation to the players but should instead relay the information to the judge so that the situation can be addressed correctly. [cite: 136]

[cite\_start]Players may always request that a spectator not observe their match. [cite: 137] [cite\_start]This request should involve a judge. [cite: 137] [cite\_start]Tournament Officials may always restrict the ability of spectators to observe matches. [cite: 138]

-----

## 3\. Tournament Operations

### 3.1 Player Minimums

[cite\_start]A tournament must have a minimum of eight players to be considered an official Disney Lorcana TCG tournament. [cite: 141] [cite\_start]If at least eight people are not present and ready to participate, the tournament is no longer officially sanctioned by Ravensburger and should be reported as Canceled. [cite: 142]

### 3.2 Round Minimums

[cite\_start]At least three rounds must be played for a tournament to be considered an official Disney Lorcana TCG tournament. [cite: 144] [cite\_start]If at least three rounds are not played, the tournament is no longer officially sanctioned by Ravensburger and should be reported as Canceled. [cite: 145] [cite\_start]For a better player experience, tournaments with more players have more rounds. [cite: 146] [cite\_start]The recommended number of rounds to be played based on the number of players in the first round are as follows: [cite: 147]

| Players | Swiss Rounds | Playoff Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 8 | 3 Single-Elimination Rounds | None |
| 9-16 | 4 for Limited tournament with Booster Draft Playoff\<br\>5 for Core Constructed | Top 8 Booster Draft (if Limited)\<br\>Top 4 (if Core Constructed) |
| 17-32 | 5 | Top 8 |
| 33-64 | 6 | Top 8 |
| 65-128 | 7 | Top 8 |
| 129-226 | 8 | Top 8 |

[cite\_start][cite: 148]

### 3.3 Match Structure

[cite\_start]The Disney Lorcana TCG is played in a best-of-three format. [cite: 150] [cite\_start]In practice, this means that the players will play games until one player has won two games. [cite: 151] [cite\_start]Drawn games do not count as wins. [cite: 152] [cite\_start]If the match is concluded before one player has won two games, then the player who has won the most games is the winner of the match. [cite: 152] [cite\_start]If both players have the same number of wins at this point, the match is a draw. [cite: 153]

[cite\_start]Before the match begins, the players must randomly decide which player has the choice of playing first or second. [cite: 154] [cite\_start]Any mutually agreed-upon method may be used, such as rolling dice or flipping a coin. [cite: 155] [cite\_start]The deciding player then chooses whether they will play first or second. [cite: 156] [cite\_start]The player who plays first does not draw a card at the start of their first turn. [cite: 157]

[cite\_start]For any games after the first in a match, the player who lost the most recent game chooses whether to play first or second in the next game. [cite: 159] [cite\_start]If the most recent game was a draw, then the same player who chose for that game chooses for the next game as well. [cite: 160] [cite\_start]The decision to play first or second must be made before the player sees their opening hand for that game. [cite: 161] [cite\_start]If the player fails to do so, they are assumed to be playing first. [cite: 162]

### 3.4 Match Procedure

When beginning a game, players first decide which player is playing first as described in section 3.3. [cite\_start]Each player shuffles their deck and offers their opponent the opportunity for additional shuffling and/or cutting. [cite: 165] [cite\_start]Then, each player draws their opening hand of seven cards. [cite: 166] [cite\_start]For every game of a match, each player has the opportunity to alter their hand. [cite: 167]

[cite\_start]First, the first player chooses which cards from their hand they will alter and places those cards on the bottom of their deck in any order. [cite: 168] [cite\_start]Then the second player chooses which cards from their hand they will alter and places those cards on the bottom of their own deck in any order. [cite: 169] [cite\_start]Then both players draw cards until both have seven cards in their hand again. [cite: 170] [cite\_start]Finally, any player who placed cards on the bottom of their deck in this manner shuffles their deck and then offers their opponent the opportunity for additional shuffling and/or cutting. [cite: 171]

[cite\_start]Once this process has been completed, the first player begins their first turn. [cite: 172] [cite\_start]They will not draw a card for this turn. [cite: 173]

[cite\_start]Once time has been called in a round, no new games should begin. [cite: 174] [cite\_start]Any games still in progress will immediately proceed to the end-of-match procedure, as follows: [cite: 175]

  * [cite\_start]The active player finishes their turn. [cite: 176]
  * [cite\_start]After that turn, there are five turns total remaining in the game. [cite: 177] [cite\_start]Each turn taken after the turn during which time was called will count toward the five-game total, regardless of whose turn it is. [cite: 178] [cite\_start]Normally, this means that the active player when time was called will get two turns and the non-active player will get three turns. [cite: 179]
  * [cite\_start]If the game ends during these turns, the match is reported normally. [cite: 180]
  * [cite\_start]If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five and one player has more game wins than the other, that player wins the match. [cite: 181] [cite\_start](The current game does not count toward the match result.) [cite: 182]
  * [cite\_start]**Swiss rounds:** If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five and both players have the same number of game wins, the match is a draw. [cite: 183] [cite\_start](The current game does not count toward the match result.) [cite: 184]
  * [cite\_start]**Single-elimination rounds:** If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five and both players have the same number of game wins and the same lore, the match continues until one player has more lore than the other. [cite: 185] [cite\_start]Once this happens, the player with the highest lore wins the game immediately. [cite: 186]

### 3.5 Concessions and Intentional Draws

[cite\_start]A player may concede an incomplete game at any time. [cite: 188] [cite\_start]That player immediately loses the game and, if applicable, the match moves on to the next game. [cite: 189] [cite\_start]A player who refuses to play a match is considered to have conceded that match. [cite: 190]

[cite\_start]Players may not ask their opponents to concede a game. [cite: 192] [cite\_start]Players may not implicitly or explicitly, offer or accept any reward or consideration in exchange for a concession. [cite: 193] [cite\_start]Players provided such an offer are required to call a judge and report the offer. [cite: 194]

[cite\_start]Prior to the end of a match, players may agree to draw the match. [cite: 195] [cite\_start]A player may only request an intentional draw once per match, and may not implicitly or explicitly offer any reward or consideration in exchange for a draw. [cite: 196] [cite\_start]Players provided such an offer are required to call a judge and report the offer. [cite: 197]

### 3.6 Deck Registration

[cite\_start]Players in Competitive Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are required to register their decks. [cite: 199] [cite\_start]For a Constructed tournament, players must submit their deck list either via www.Melee.gg or on a paper deck list, per instructions from the Tournament Organizer or Head Judge. [cite: 200] [cite\_start]The Tournament Organizer will communicate the deck list submission deadline. [cite: 201] [cite\_start]If no such deadline is communicated, the deck lists will be due before the first round is created. [cite: 202]

[cite\_start]For a Limited tournament, players will fill out a deck list as part of deck construction. [cite: 203] [cite\_start]These deck lists will be provided to a Tournament Official by the end of deck construction. [cite: 204] [cite\_start]Players may request to see their deck list between matches. [cite: 205] [cite\_start]These requests will be granted whenever feasible. [cite: 205]

[cite\_start]Deck lists are considered the ultimate arbiter of which cards the player intended to play. [cite: 206] [cite\_start]Players must take care to use complete card names, since many character cards have similar names. [cite: 207]

### 3.7 Deck Checks

[cite\_start]Judges at Competitive tournaments will perform deck checks as much as is feasible. [cite: 209] [cite\_start]Decks should be checked after shuffling has completed but before opening hands are drawn. [cite: 210] [cite\_start]Deck checks are intended to verify that players are playing the correct deck as registered on their deck list. [cite: 211]

### 3.8 Dropping from a Tournament

[cite\_start]A player may drop from the tournament at any time. [cite: 213] [cite\_start]Players are responsible for either dropping themselves using Melee.gg or by informing a Judge or Scorekeeper. [cite: 214] [cite\_start]If the player is currently paired for any matches when the request to drop is made, that player is considered to have conceded all games in that match. [cite: 215] [cite\_start]Players who do not show up for their match will be dropped from the tournament unless they inform the Scorekeeper before that round ends. [cite: 216]

[cite\_start]If a player drops during a Limited tournament, they keep all cards provided to them to by the tournament organizer to participate in the event. [cite: 217] [cite\_start]This includes opened and partially drafted booster packs. [cite: 218]

-----

## 4\. Information and Communication

### 4.1 Written Notes

[cite\_start]Players are encouraged to keep written track of lore totals, but no other written notes are permitted. [cite: 221] [cite\_start]Referring to outside notes during a match is considered Outside Assistance. [cite: 222] [cite\_start]Players must not take notes during drafting. [cite: 224]

### 4.2 Electronic Devices

[cite\_start]At Casual tournaments, players may use the Disney Lorcana TCG Companion app for tracking lore and referring to the card catalog as long as any references are made in a timely manner. [cite: 226] [cite\_start]At Competitive tournaments, electronic devices capable of long-term data storage and/or internet access are not permitted. [cite: 227]

### 4.3 In-Game Information

[cite\_start]During games, players are expected to communicate openly with their opponents. [cite: 229]

[cite\_start]When adding a card to their inkwell through the normal once-per-turn action, the player adding the card must ensure that their opponent has full knowledge of which card is being added, including by announcing the name of the card. [cite: 230] [cite\_start]The opponent must be allowed to verify that the card has the inkwell symbol around the cost. [cite: 231]

[cite\_start]The current status of any card in play (exerted or ready, damage marked, whether the card's ink is dry, etc.) must be completely and correctly communicated by that card's player whenever requested by another player. [cite: 232]

[cite\_start]When a player has multiple simultaneous actions to resolve, that player must announce the order of resolution before beginning to resolve the first one. [cite: 233] [cite\_start]The order cannot change once the first action has begun. [cite: 234]

[cite\_start]Exerted cards should be rotated ninety degrees clockwise to indicate their status. [cite: 235] [cite\_start]Ready cards should be upright. [cite: 235] [cite\_start]A player may choose to exert their cards in the counterclockwise direction if they choose, but they should be consistent with all of their cards. [cite: 236]

[cite\_start]Lore gains must always be announced and must include the new lore total after the lore increase for that player. [cite: 237] [cite\_start]This ensures that both players fully understand the current lore score and that any discrepancies can be found and remedied as soon as possible, likely with the help of a Judge. [cite: 238]

[cite\_start]Players are expected to maintain a clear game state whenever possible. [cite: 239] [cite\_start]This includes pointing out mandatory effects whenever they occur, even if they are from an opponent's card. [cite: 240] [cite\_start]For purposes of this rule, a "mandatory effect" is one that does not include the word "may" in its text. [cite: 241] [cite\_start]Failing to remind a player of a "may" effect is not against the rules, but players are encouraged to remind their opponents of these effects in order to foster the most positive play experience for all involved. [cite: 242]

### 4.4 Inkwell

[cite\_start]Players are required to keep their inkwell cards distinct and separate from any other facedown cards that may be on the table. [cite: 244] [cite\_start]If there is ever any confusion about which cards are in a player's inkwell, the players should call a judge immediately so the error can be remedied. [cite: 245] [cite\_start]Additionally, all ready cards in a player's inkwell must be oriented in the same direction as each other; the same must also be true for exerted cards in that player's inkwell. [cite: 246, 247]

-----

## 5\. Constructed Tournament Formats

### 5.1 Constructed Overview

[cite\_start]"Constructed" describes any event where players are expected to build their decks ahead of time. [cite: 251] [cite\_start]Currently, there is only one Constructed format, Core, but more may be added in future updates. [cite: 252]

  * [cite\_start]Constructed decks must contain at least 60 cards. [cite: 253] [cite\_start]There is no maximum deck size, but a player must be able to shuffle their deck in a timely manner without assistance. [cite: 253]
  * [cite\_start]Constructed decks must not contain cards from more than two ink colors. [cite: 254] [cite\_start]For example, if a deck contains Amber and Amethyst cards, it must not contain any Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, or Steel cards. [cite: 255]
  * [cite\_start]Constructed decks must not contain more than four of a single card as identified by its full English card name. [cite: 256] [cite\_start]Character cards with different subtitles are considered different cards for purposes of this rule. [cite: 257] [cite\_start]For example, a deck may contain up to four copies of *Ariel - On Human Legs* as well as up to four copies of *Ariel - Spectacular Singer*. [cite: 258]

-----

## 6\. Limited Tournament Formats

### 6.1 Limited Overview

[cite\_start]"Limited" describes any event where players are provided with unopened Disney Lorcana TCG product and are expected to build their decks on site during the tournament. [cite: 261] [cite\_start]There are three Limited formats: Sealed, Preconstructed, and Draft. [cite: 262]

  * [cite\_start]Limited decks in Sealed and Draft must contain at least 40 cards. [cite: 263] [cite\_start]There is no maximum deck size, except that decks are limited in size by the card pool they are built from. [cite: 264]
  * [cite\_start]Limited decks are not restricted in how many ink types they may contain. [cite: 265]
  * [cite\_start]Limited decks may contain any number of copies of any individual card. [cite: 266] [cite\_start]For example, if a player in a Sealed tournament opens six copies of *Genie - The Ever Impressive*, they may play all six in their deck. [cite: 267]

### 6.2 Sealed

[cite\_start]In a Sealed tournament, each player is provided with a set of unopened booster packs from which they will build their deck. [cite: 269] [cite\_start]The minimum number of boosters to be provided for Sealed tournaments is six packs per player, from the set(s) of the tournament organizer's choice. [cite: 270] [cite\_start]Each player begins with the same number of boosters from each set selected. [cite: 271]

### 6.3 Preconstructed

[cite\_start]In a Preconstructed tournament, players are provided with a random starter deck from the set chosen for the tournament. [cite: 273] [cite\_start]Players may add or exchange any number of cards between the preconstructed deck and the booster pack included in their starter deck product. [cite: 274] [cite\_start]Since the provided preconstructed deck starts at 60 cards, the deck must be a minimum of 60 cards after the deck construction period. [cite: 275] [cite\_start]Limited-format decks may contain cards of more than two inks. [cite: 276] [cite\_start]Preconstructed events are only Casual tournaments. [cite: 277]

### 6.4 Draft

[cite\_start]In a Draft tournament, players take turns selecting, or "drafting," cards from previously unopened booster packs to form their card pools. [cite: 280] [cite\_start]The minimum number of boosters to be provided for Draft tournaments is four packs per player, from the set(s) of the tournament organizer's choice. [cite: 281] [cite\_start]Each player begins with the same number of boosters from each set selected. [cite: 282]

[cite\_start]Players are seated into random groups of people, these groups are called pods. [cite: 283] [cite\_start]The number of people in each pod is at the discretion of the head judge, although these guidelines should usually be followed: [cite: 284]

  * [cite\_start]Each pod should have as close to eight players as possible [cite: 285]
  * [cite\_start]No pod should have five or fewer players [cite: 286]
  * [cite\_start]There should be no more than one pod with an uneven number of players. [cite: 287]

[cite\_start]Following these guidelines, here are the recommended pod sizes for smaller tournaments: [cite: 288]

| \# of Players | Pods |
| :--- | :--- |
| 6-11 | 1 pod |
| 12-14 | 1 pod of 6\<br\>1 pod of 6 to 8 |
| 15-17 | 1 pod of 8 |
| 18 | 3 pods of 6 |
| 19-20 | 2 pods of 6\<br\>1 pod of 7 or 8 |
| 21 | Pod of 6\<br\>Pod of 7\<br\>Pod of 8 |
| 22 | Pod of 6\<br\>2 pods of 8 |
| 23 | Pod of 7\<br\>2 pods of 8 |

[cite\_start][cite: 289]

[cite\_start]For the first pack, each player opens the pack, selects one card to add to their card pool, then passes the remaining cards to their left. [cite: 290] [cite\_start]Then they collect the pack from their right, select a card, and pass the remaining cards to their left. [cite: 291] [cite\_start]Card selection continues in this manner until all cards from the pack have been drafted. [cite: 292] [cite\_start]The direction of passing reverses for each pack: the second pack is passed to the right, the third pack is passed to the left, and so on. [cite: 293] [cite\_start]Once all packs have been drafted, each player's picks become their completed card pool for deck construction. [cite: 294]

[cite\_start]In Casual Draft tournaments, players may be paired against any other player in the tournament. [cite: 295] [cite\_start]In Competitive Draft tournaments, players must be paired against players in their own pod. [cite: 296]

-----

## 7\. Time Limits

### 7.1 General Tournament Time Limits

[cite\_start]The time limit for a Swiss round is 50 minutes. [cite: 300] [cite\_start]It is recommended that all matches in single-elimination rounds are untimed. [cite: 301] [cite\_start]If a time limit must be imposed due to venue availability constraints, the time limit should be at least 50 minutes and should be announced prior to the beginning of the single-elimination portion of the event. [cite: 302]

[cite\_start]If all matches have finished before the time limit is up in a round, the Head Judge may choose to start the next round early. [cite: 303] [cite\_start]No players should be issued a Tardiness penalty if they arrive before the previous round would have ended. [cite: 304]
